# HACKccessibility: expose the documentation and contribution guides that live in developers heads!

## Forewords

Ever encountered a program with too little documentation or got lost in documenting the project you develop?

You're at the good place!

A wizard is currently being trained to help you to easily document your code or the one of programs with little documentation.

This repo is in early alpha, so please be ready for some unfinished features.

This project is highly contribution-friendly (developed during the [Mozilla Open Leaders program](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/)). All types of contributions, starting from :thumbup: will be highly valued!

## Description of the project

Documentation requires a lot of human energy.

Tons of programs are fully featured and yet little documented.

An HACKccessibility wizard will help developers to document undocumented code and a webapp populated by data from an analysis of git repositories will provide insight on pieces of code with regards to their documentation and code patterns. A set of free software projects exposing little documentation will be contacted and proposed to use the wizard for documentation sprints. 

## Demonstrations

On the code of Searx: https://github.com/jibe-b/searx/tree/hackccessibility-little_documented


## How to contribute

- Tell us the cool features you would like to see in a [new issue](https://gitlab.com/jibe-b/HACKccessibility-expose-the-documentation/issues/new)
- Come discuss about the general architecture of the wizard [in the issues](https://gitlab.com/jibe-b/HACKccessibility-expose-the-documentation/issues)
- pull requests are highly welcome!

As a rule of thumb, contributors should follow the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)


## Roadmap

- [ ] (doing) first prototype of the wizard (go see the [dev branch](https://gitlab.com/jibe-b/HACKccessibility-expose-the-documentation/tree/dev))
- [ ] (soon) expand the list of features of the wizard 
- [ ] (on the long term) iterate over code repos, increasing the list of features

Do you have a repo with some code that has little documentation? Register it to the [list of test repos](https://gitlab.com/jibe-b/HACKccessibility-expose-the-documentation/issues/3)!
