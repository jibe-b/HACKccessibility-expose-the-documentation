# HACKccessibility: expose the documentation and contribution guides that live in developers heads!

## Forewords

Ever encountered a program with too little documentation or got lost in documenting the project you develop?

You're at the good place!

A wizard is currently being trained to help you to easily document your code or the one of programs with little documentation.

This repo is in early alpha, so please be ready for some unfinished features.

This project is highly contribution-friendly (developed during the [Mozilla Open Leaders program](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/)). All types of contributions, starting from :thumbup: will be highly valued!

## Description of the project

Documentation requires a lot of human energy.

Tons of programs are fully featured and yet little documented.

An HACKccessibility wizard will help developers to document undocumented code and a webapp populated by data from an analysis of git repositories will provide insight on pieces of code with regards to their documentation and code patterns. A set of free software projects exposing little documentation will be contacted and proposed to use the wizard for documentation sprints.
