# HACKccessibility: expose the documentation and contribution guides that live in developers heads!

Documentation requires a lot of human energy. Tons of programs are fully featured and yet little documented. An HACKccessibility wizard will help developers to document undocumented code and a webapp populated by data from an analysis of git repositories will provide insight on pieces of code with regards to their documentation and code patterns. A set of free software projects exposing little documentation will be contacted and proposed to use the wizard for documentation sprints.
